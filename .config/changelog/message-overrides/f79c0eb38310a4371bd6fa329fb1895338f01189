feat: Adjust tool executable name to include the ".cmd" file extension

Adjust the expected tool executable names to include "asciidoctor.cmd" respectively "asciidoctor-pdf.cmd".
This allows the aliases to use the "bin stubs" scripts generated by Bundler on Windows ("bundle" generates the stubs using the ".cmd" file extension rather than ".bat" which is used by the "gem" tool)
